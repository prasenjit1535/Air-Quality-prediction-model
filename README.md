# Air-Quality-prediction-model
🌍 Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project predicts air quality based on various environmental parameters using four machine learning algorithms:

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Ridge Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts air pollution levels based on input features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pollutant concentrations (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, CO).

🔬 Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains real-world air quality measurements.

It includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pollutant levels (PM2.5, NO2, CO, etc.).

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
📌 Findings: The Decision Tree Regressor overfits the training data, leading to poor generalization. Ridge Regression provides a better balance between bias and variance.
